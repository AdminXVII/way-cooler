# D-Bus IPC, Background separation.

## Major Highlights
- Switched IPC to D-Bus
  - To run in a TTY session, need to start Way Cooler with `dbus-launch --exit-with-session way-cooler`
- Removed background program, it is now a [separate project](https://github.com/Immington-Industries/way-cooler-bg)
  - Added support for images, including png, jpg, and gif formats.
  - Fixed issue where the cursor could not be loaded on some distros (such as Ubuntu). We now package a backup cursor icon.

## Tiling/Layout
- Can now resize windows
  - When resizing tiled windows, it is ensured that you can not make them size 0.
  - Resize with `ctrl+<right-click>` and drag.
- Can now make windows floating with `Alt+Shift+Space`
  - Switch between floating and non-floating with `Alt+Space`
- Way Cooler now remembers what window you last had focused, using a clever "path" system to keep track of active paths.
- Fixed problem where the active path was not being updated properly when switching workspaces
- Reduced the number of debug print statements.

## Init file
- Added special function `way_cooler_init`. This function will be triggered after Way Cooler has completed initialization. It is where all start up programs should go, and ultimately will be a nice place to hand out tokens when we implement security levels to the IPC.
