# Border improvements, configurable pointer snap, bug fixes

## Resizing
* There is now an option to select the behaviour of the mouse when resizing (e.g, snap to the window like in Awesome, or don't snap anywhere like in i3). See the updated default configuration for more information.  #269
  + This added a new configuration category, `mouse`. This will be expanded later to provide more options for the mouse, including libinput configuration once #189 is addressed.

## Borders
* Title bars will now update their text to reflect the title of the window #270
* Gaps and borders can now be used at the same time #263
* Active border color should now work better (e.g less times when two are highlighted active, or when none of them are even though the user is focused on a window) #263

## Windows
* Popup windows now attempt to focus in the center of the screen, and are never too small than the minimum floating window limit. #264
  + Note that due to limitations in Xwayland, they may not always have their geometry properly set, so they may still sometimes appear in the top left corner.
* Way Cooler now remembers which view you focused on within in a container. In other words, the algorithm to select the last active window is now one-to-one with i3. #204

## Bug Fixes
Sending containers across workspaces will no longer cause a duplicate active number (and a crash) #267
