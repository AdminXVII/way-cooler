# EOL WLC, extension program improvements, better tiling borders

This is the final release of Way Cooler that will utilize wlc. From this point forward, consider [rust-wlc](https://github.com/way-cooler/rust-wlc) abandoned. 

Way Cooler is switching to [wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots). You can follow the porting process [on our wlroots-rs bindings repo](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots-rs). Once those bindings are complete, Way Cooler will switch to wlroots for v0.8.0. Once the move is complete, work will begin again on making Way Cooler function as a drop-in replacement for AwesomeWM.

# Distribution
* NixOS users can now enjoy a much more complete Way Cooler experince thanks to the work done by @gnidorah. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/issues/446)
* Install script from http://way-cooler.org/download now properly sets the uid bit for non-systemd systems. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/issues/398)
* Raspberry Pi's are now officially supported. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/issues/369)
* It is now possible to compile Way Cooler for ArmV7 devices. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/issues/445)

# Extension Programs
Note that all of the extension programs (`wc-bg`, `wc-lock`, and `wc-grab`) have **backward incompatible** changes in this release. Previous versions will not work as expected!

## Background
The following changes take effect in [this release](https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler-bg/releases/tag/v0.3.0):
* The background program binary has been renamed to `wc-bg` (originally `way-cooler-bg`).
* The background program now properly assigns backgrounds to all outputs.
* A default background is now used when the background program is provided no arguments. Thanks to @platipo for the background contribution! (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/issues/141)
* The background program no longer uses a hack in order to render but uses the standard desktop-shell Wayland protocol.
  + As a consequence, you can now use `sway-bg` on Way Cooler and `wc-bg` on Sway.
  
## Lockscreen
* The lockscreen program no longer uses a hack in order to render but uses a modified version of the desktop-shell protocol.
  + It is modified so that we can lock multiple screens using an effect. This may change in the future, but that means we are non-standard compared to e.g Sway.
* Added a fancy new blur effect that will blur the screen when it locks. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler-lock/releases/tag/v0.2.0)

## Screenshot taker
* Updated to use the latest D-Bus protocol. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler-grab/releases/tag/v0.3.0)

# Way Cooler
## Configuration
* Can now choose whether root containers have borders or not. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/451)

## Dependencies
* Moved from hlua to rlua in preparation for AwesomeWM compatibility. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/issues/378)
* Updated wayland-rs to v0.12.0. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/452)
  + Fixes build error on some Ubuntu systems. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/452)
* Updated petgraph to v0.4.7 (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/400)
* Updated rust-wlc.

## WLC updates
* Updated to use the latest pointer motion callback. This fixes the rounding bug that would cause the mouse to not perform as expected. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/453)
* Can now copy text from/to pure Wayland and XWayland clients. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/issues/328)

## AwesomeWM Compatibility
* Started preleminary work on AwesomeWM compatibilty. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/383, https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/396, https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/429, https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/423)
  + Most of this is setting up the OO and signal systems used by the Lua libraries. This is mostly complete and all that's left is implementing the interfaces.

## Lua
* Config directory now included in Lua's `package.path` (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/352)
* Defaulting to the pre-compiled configuration fallback now properly cleans up state from the previous Lua instance. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/issues/382)

## Tiling
* Tabbed/Stacked tiling made much more like i3. Special thanks to @Arnaz87 for putting the work in to fix the rendering! (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/439, https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/450)
* Floating containers no longer show in Tabbed/Stacked list. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/issues/440)
* Title bar now displayed correctly even when its value is different from the other border sizes. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/issues/410)
* Floating containers are now properly pulled forward again when focused. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/432, https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/issues/412)
* When a floating view is the focused view it is now properly displayed on top of other floating views (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/issues/415, https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/pull/413)

## Soundness fixes
* Spawning programs no longer sometimes triggers a segfault. (https://github.com/way-cooler/way-cooler/issues/430)
