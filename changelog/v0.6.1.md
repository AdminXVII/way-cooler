# Documentation and Bug fixes

## New features
This version introduces two new features: The ability to unbind keybindings and to allow passthrough for keybindings. See #345 for more details.

## Changes to existing features
* Root level containers have always have borders now. #315 
* If `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` doesn't exist, an error explaining that is logged. #310 

## Bugfixes
* Screen scraping doesn't scrape active output (needs v0.2 of `wc-grab`) #349 
* Nested sub containers do not render borders properly when using new container command when a new container can't be spawned (e.g when there's one child) #344 
* Popup windows are no longer sized incorrectly #337 
* Popup windows should now be always centered on the screen correctly #218
* Switching containers to a new workspace will no longer cause it to be invisible on a workspace that is not active. If it is moved to an inactive workspace, that one is made visible instead #333 
* Floating windows now update their focused colour correctly #320 
* Floating sub windows (e.g right click menus) no longer spawn with borders #319 
* Floating windows (such as dmenu) are no longer hidden when spawned in a tabbed/stacked container #317 



* Nested Tabbed/Stacked borders are now rendered correctly #313
