# Basic binary distribution, in-place restart, tiling fixes

## Configuration
- Can now restart Way Cooler in place. Will restart the background program (if any), and reload all keybindings and other options.

## Tiling
- Can now open a new window even if there is no currently active container
- Closing a window now uses the "recently used" path to focus on the next window
- Popup windows will now stay on their workspaces and not otherwise do weird things (mostly)
- Floating windows are now always rendered above tiled windows
- Floating an empty workspace no longer causes Way Cooler to hang

## Logistics
- Way Cooler can now be compiled statically with wlc 
- Basic binary distribution. Currently only x86_64,  will later have i686 and armv6 here as well. To install, unpack the tar file and run `install.sh`
- Added a login manager entry for Way Cooler (confirmed to work on light-dm and gdm)

## Background
- `way-cooler-bg` no longer needs to have a cursor file specified.
