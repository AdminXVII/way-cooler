# Fullscreen command, tiling fixes, better diagnostics 

## Commands / Keybindings
- Added fullscreen command
  - Default keybinding is `mod+f`
  - Command is also exposed through the D-Bus command `FullScreen`
- Added commands to control the location of the pointer.
  - Absolute positioning (`SetPointerPos`)
  - Placing the mouse at the corner of a container (`GrabAtCorner`)
- Modifier for mouse controls (eg resize and move window) is now configurable
  - The default modifier is now `Alt`, instead of the previous `Ctrl`

## Tiling
- Popup windows now automatically are floating.
- Wayland apps (eg `termite`, `weston-terminal`, etc) should no longer have blurry text.
- Resizing a window while running Way Cooler from a TTY now works correctly.

## Logging
- Way Cooler now log all environment variables in the prelude of the log.
- When a key is bound to a command that is now logged.

## Background
- Resizing the output / changing the resolution will now properly update the background.

## Misc
- Already existing debug checks have been turned on for release builds.
- Restart should properly call the user-defined restart callback now.
- Updated to use the `StableGraph` of Petgraph, which should improve performance and reliability.
