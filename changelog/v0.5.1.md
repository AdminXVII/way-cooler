# Bug fixes, more configuration changes

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed race condition that caused tree instability (e.g a crash)
  - This was normally triggered by closing e.g `mpv` with the close window command.

## Configuration

**Backwards incompatible changes**
- Cleaned up util functions
- Removed `spawn_dmenu` and `spawn_terminal` command, please use `util.program.spawn_once` instead.
