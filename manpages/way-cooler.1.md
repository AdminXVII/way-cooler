way-cooler - AwesomeWM-based customizable Wayland compositor (window manager)

SYNOPSIS
--------

*way-cooler* [*--version*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*way-cooler* is a tiling window manager for WayLand based on AwesomeWM. It handles windows based on dynamic layouts with the help of the *awesome* utilitary.

It provides the user with multiple desktop views by the means of tags. Each window is assigned one or more tags, which dictates (in most cases) the layout it will use.

OPTIONS
-------
*--version*:
    Print version information to standard output, then exit.

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------
*way-cooler* can (and should) be customized by launching the *awesome* command (not the original AwesomeWM one) with a custom '.config/way-cooler/rc.lua' file.
