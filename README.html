<p>Way Cooler is the spiritual successor of <a href="https://awesomewm.org/">AwesomeWM</a> for <a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org/">Wayland</a>. It is written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org">Rust</a> and uses <a href="https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots">wlroots</a>.</p>

<h1>Development</h1>

<p>Way Cooler is under very active development right now. Currently, master is not usable for production. There are old versions of Way Cooler that do work, however:
* They use an old framework, <a href="https://github.com/Cloudef/wlc">wlc</a>, and thus are very limited and buggy.
* Was not designed to emulate Awesome, but instead has <a href="https://i3wm.org">i3</a> tiling and its own (very incomplete) Lua libraries.</p>

<p>There will be another release this year, v0.9.0. It will be the last release before 1.0. 1.0 is defined to be 100% compatible with AwesomeWM.</p>
