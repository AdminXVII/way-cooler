//! A registry of values, available both internally to Way Cooler
//! and its clients.
//!
//! The registry is divided into "categories", which gives the values some
//! semblance of structure (e.g window properties are part of the "windows"
//! category) while also allowing fine grain permissions for clients
//! (e.g most clients can read properties about windows,
//! but cannot modify them)
//!
//! Once a category has been created, you cannot overwrite it. However, you can
//! overwrite the data within the category assuming you have write permissions
//! for that category.
//!
//! Access is controlled by the `registry::Access` struct, which ensures
//! that the user of the registry can actually access the values its
//! trying to access
