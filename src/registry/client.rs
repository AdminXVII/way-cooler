//! The module that controls access to the registry.
//!
//! Permissions for clients live here, which can either be `Read` or `Write`
//! (which includes ability to read).
//!
//! A `Permission` is associated with a canonical category name, with the
//! `Client` controlling all permissions for known categories.
//!
//! Note that it's possible for the `Client` to not know about any given
//! category, effectively making those permissions `None` (because it doesn't
//! even know that it exists).
//!
//! This is the only way to access the registry, allowing the underlying
//! implementation to be simple and allow later optimizations.
