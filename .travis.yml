  # Test and upload coverage to coveralls
  # Justification of excluded files:
  # main.rs: just initialization of logging, sigkill handler, and initializing lazy static objects. (Arg parsing should be moved into a different module and tested)
  # mod.rs: although at the moment we have too much code in various mod.rs's these are not really testable either way
  # tests.rs: should not be running on our tests themselves
  # wayland_client_api.rs: we really don't have a good way of testing any of this. At the moment it's simple enough that if it didn't work it would be obvious in user testing.
  # callbacks.rs: we don't have any integration tests for callbacks right now. They'd need to deal with the lazy statics that the other components of the program live in.
